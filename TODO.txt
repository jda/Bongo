Web interface for managing AP list
AP list to be stored in a SQLite DB
APs referenced internally by a APID.

APID refers to a AP role at a specific site.
 This allows us to change AP IP address or MAC address 
 without breaking associations.

AP Poller
Config change recording and number of clients
Relatively low run frequency. Once every hour perhaps.
Stats stored in SQLite or RRD, per APID

SM Poller
Knows how many SMs to look for and how to find them
 thanks to the AP poller.
Needs to poll every SM once every 5 minutes.

Stats stored in SQLite or RRD, per MAC address.

AP/SM reactor:
Listens for SNMP traps and initiates targeted polling 
 in response.
